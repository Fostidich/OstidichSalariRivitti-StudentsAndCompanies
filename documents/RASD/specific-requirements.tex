\section{Design constraints}

This section outlines the constraints impacting design choices, including regulatory standards, technical limitations, and specific requirements.
These constraints guide compliance and design feasibility.

\subsection{Standards compliance}

Specications described in this document must be respected by the system.
The source code of the application must be commented and documented adequately.

Moreover, the system should respect the laws about privacy and data protection of the country in which it is used.

\subsection{Hardware limitations}

To access the system the user must have a device with a web browser and an internet connection.

%\subsection{Any other constraint}

\section{Software system attributes}

This section describes essential software attributes like performance, security, and maintainability, which define the quality and user experience of the system.

\subsection{Availability}

The system must operate continuously, ensuring 24/7 access with downtime below 1\%.
Any failure must be resolved within 1 hour to minimize service disruption.

\subsection{Reliability}

To maintain consistent performance, the system should be designed with high redundancy and fault tolerance, reducing the risk of critical failures.

\subsection{Security}

Data encryption is crucial to protect sensitive user information, including personal details and passwords.
All such data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest, ensuring it remains secure against unauthorized access.

Access control is enforced through a robust authentication and authorization mechanism that restricts data and functionality access according to user roles.
Passwords are securely hashed and stored, further safeguarding user credentials.

The system ensures responsible handling of personal data, requiring explicit user consent and implementing clear procedures for data protection.
Users have the right to access their data and request its deletion, promoting transparency and control over personal information.

To uphold high security standards, regular security audits and vulnerability assessments are scheduled.
These help identify and mitigate any emerging risks, continuously enhancing system security.

\subsection{Maintainability}

The system must be designed with maintainability in mind, ensuring that future updates, bug fixes, and feature enhancements can be implemented efficiently.

\subsection{Portability}

The system is designed to be platform-independent, accessible from any device with a web browser and an internet connection. The user interface is responsive and optimized for various screen sizes and resolutions.

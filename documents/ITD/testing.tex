As for the testing process, xUnit was used to implement comprehensive and exhaustive integration tests.
These tests are designed to thoroughly evaluate the application’s behavior by simulating real-world scenarios.
A real, seeded in-memory database, that mirrors the production environment, was instantiated, ensuring that the tests run against a realistic data set and query behavior.
Essentially, each test involves launching the entire application, allowing verifing that all components interact correctly during runtime.

Our integration tests cover the full scope of the application’s logic, including database queries, business logic, and API responses.
Each API endpoint is tested to ensure it responds correctly for every potential status code and response message.
This exhaustive coverage ensures that all parts of the system, from data access to application responses, function as expected in a controlled test environment.

In the end, more than 200 test methods were ran and passed, for a total of almost 40 APIs.

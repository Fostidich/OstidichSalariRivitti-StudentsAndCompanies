\chapter{Test cases}
\section{Premise}
It is our duty to point out that after having populated the database with the data provided by the authors,
the credentials given to us do not allow access to the app and therefore,
since it is impossible to create an account for a company, it is impossible for us to evaluate certain functionalities
\section{Testing}
This section outlines the test procedures we conducted to evaluate both the functionality and adherence to the project product's functions, as outlined in the RASD provided.
Each test case was designed to include the most relevant usage scenarios from the user's point of view.
Below is a complete list of the test cases performed to validate product performance and compliance.
For each one, the objective, the steps performed, the cases considered and the results obtained are indicated.

    A user can sign up with credential that already has been used.
    The application doesn't check the cv is major than 5 MB (In the RASD is written that the file size limit is 5MB).
    A user can use an invalid format of the email, the feedback of the system shows that the user has been registered successfully but the user can't log in.
    \end{itemize}

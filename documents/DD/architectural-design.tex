\chapter{Architectural design}

\section{Overview}

In the S\&C application, four high-level components can be distinguished: the backend server, the DBMS, the email service, and the frontend interface.

The backend server is the main component of the system, as it contains every piece of business logic required to satisfy the goals specified in the RASD document.
The role of the DBMS is the usual, which is providing interaction with a database by executing command operations.
The email service is used to validate the user account at sign up time, since the verification link is sent via email.  
Lastly, the frontend interface is the web page reachable by the user from a browser.

\section{Component view}

\htitle{Frontend interface}
It is the the web application used by the client, which is reachable by any browser.
The full range of operations that it provides to the user can only be used after the authentication process, performed by the \textit{Authentication service}.
It allows both students and companies to perform a certain set of actions based on the type of user.

\htitle{Web application}
It is used as an intermediary between the frontend and the backend.
Its purpose is to manage the browser UI pages independently and transparently from the point of view of the other server components.
Its APIs are meant to ease the HTML body filling process done from other components.

\htitle{Authentication service}
It provides the set of procedures required to handle the authentication of a user into the system.
It manages the log in and sign up phases.

\htitle{Email service}
Its main goal is to implement all the procedures that the server requires in order to send email messages to the user.
Mainly, this component allows the \textit{authentication service} to send a verification email when handling the sign up of a user.  

\htitle{Notification service}
The purpose of this component is to collect and manage all the notifications that a user receives.
It defines the notification types and allows other components easily to send them.
